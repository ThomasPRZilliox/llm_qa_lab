# LLM QA Lab

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly framework for testing Question-Answering (QA) with Large Language Models (LLMs). This need arose with the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where traditional training, validation, and testing datasets are not always available. Instead, users can provide expected answers based on custom inputs, enabling flexible evaluation without predefined datasets.
